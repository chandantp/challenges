### Notes

1. The solution is written in Scala

2. For building and running the Scala program, SBT is required.
To install SBT, run **./installSBT.sh**

Refer to http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html for information on installing SBT on Linux.

3. For running the program, execute **./run.sh**

4. The results file **"results.txt"** is generated in the current directory

### Caveat
* DO NOT USE OPEN JDK!
* Please use Oracle JDK 1.8 with SBT as SBT does not play nice with Open JDK

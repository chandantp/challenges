1. The solution is written in Scala

2. For running the Scala program, SBT is required

3. To install SBT 0.13.12 on Ubuntu, invoke ./installSBT.sh 

./installSBT.sh runs the following commands:

echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt

Refer to http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html for information on installing SBT on Linux.

4. For running the program, from the directory containing run.sh, invoke ./run.sh

5. The results file "results.txt" is generated in the current directory

CAVEAT
=========
DO NOT USE OPEN JDK!
Please use Oracle JDK 1.8 with SBT 0.13.12 as SBT does not play nice with Open JDK

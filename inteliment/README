README:
This application implements two REST API's which parses the input file and provides the ouput in the requested format.
# Is a Spring Boot application
# HTTP Basic authentication implemented using Spring Security
# Unit tests written using SpringBootTest
# Uses spring-boot-devtools for developer productivity

### IMPORTANT ###
# The input file is located at => src/main/resources/sample.txt.
The location is hardcoded into the app. 
To change the input file, modify/replace the file content.

# User "user" and password "password" has been hardcoded in src//main/java/com/inteliment/security/SecurityConfig.java
Using curl, the credentials can be passed using either of the below approaches:
1) -u user:password
2) -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="


COMPILING THE APP:
# mvn compile

RUN UNIT TESTS:
# mvn test

GENERATE EXECUTABLE JAR:
# mvn package

RUN THE APP:
# mvn spring-boot:run
# java -jar target/counter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  (Generate jar before this step)

APIs:

1.Find number of occurrences for the given strings and provide output in JSON format.
Note that the search performed is case-insensitive.

curl http://localhost:8080/counter-api/search -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==" -d '{"searchText":["Duis", "Sed", "Donec", "Augue", "Pellentesque", "123"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" –X POST
   or
curl http://localhost:8080/counter-api/search -u user:password -d '{"searchText":["Duis", "Sed", "Donec", "Augue", "Pellentesque", "123"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" –X POST

2.Find the top N occurring words and provide output in CSV format
Note that the search performed is case-insensitive.

curl http://localhost:8080/counter-api/top/20 -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==" -H "Accept: text/csv"
      (or)
curl http://localhost:8080/counter-api/top/20 -u user:password -H "Accept: text/csv"
